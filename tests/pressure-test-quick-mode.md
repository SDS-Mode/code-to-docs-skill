# Pressure Test: Quick Mode — Scenario Document

## Objective

Validate the `code-to-docs` skill in **quick mode** against a real codebase with 3-5 independent modules and 10-30K lines of code. This test ensures that:

- The skill correctly identifies and isolates modules
- Parallel dispatch launches one agent per module when 3+ modules exist
- Each agent produces a structured analysis report without over-reading
- Synthesis correctly merges module reports into a dependency graph
- Generated documentation is complete, valid, and wikilink-clean
- Quick mode correctly omits Patterns, Onboarding, and Cross-Cutting sections

---

## Phase 0: Setup

### Target Codebase Selection

**Criteria:**
- [ ] 3–5 independently analyzable modules (not just directories)
- [ ] 10–30K total LOC across all modules
- [ ] Mix of entry points (main files, index files, or exports)
- [ ] At least one inter-module dependency (to test dependency graph)
- [ ] Real-world structure (monorepo patterns, microservice layout, or feature-based organization)

### Candidate Codebases

Use one of the following for the test. Record choice in results:

1. **NanoClaw** (`/run/media/system/Dos/Projects/nanoclaw`)
   - Modules: `src/container-runtime`, `src/agents`, `src/channels`, `src/connectors`, `src/setup`
   - LOC: ~15K
   - Language: TypeScript
   - Entry: `src/index.ts`

2. **Dockhand** (`/run/media/system/Dos/Projects/dockhand`)
   - Modules: `src/lib/db`, `src/lib/components`, `src/lib/api`, `src/routes`
   - LOC: ~12K
   - Language: TypeScript/Svelte
   - Entry: `src/app.html`, `src/routes/+page.svelte`

   - Modules: `src/scheduler`, `src/bot`, `src/executor`, `src/config`
   - LOC: ~10K
   - Language: Python
   - Entry: `src/main.py`

---

## Phase 1: Intake & Analysis

### Survey & Validation

Before invoking the skill, manually verify the target codebase.

**Step 1: Confirm Module Count**

- [ ] Run: `ls -la <codebase>/src/` or appropriate module root
- [ ] List modules identified: _____________________________ (e.g., "auth, payments, scheduler, api, worker")
- [ ] Module count: __________ (should be 3–5)
- [ ] Verify each module has entry point file(s) — record paths:
  - Module 1: ________________________________
  - Module 2: ________________________________
  - Module 3: ________________________________
  - (Module 4: ________________________________)
  - (Module 5: ________________________________)

**Step 2: Rough LOC Estimate**

- [ ] Run: `find <codebase>/src -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.py" -o -name "*.js" | wc -l` (adjust extension)
- [ ] Total file count: __________
- [ ] Rough LOC (estimate): __________ K (should be 10–30K)

**Step 3: Dependency Snapshot**

- [ ] Record primary language(s): ___________________________ (e.g., TypeScript, Python)
- [ ] Record build system: ______________________________ (e.g., npm, poetry, cargo)
- [ ] Identify at least one expected inter-module dependency:
  - Module A → Module B: ________________________________

---

### Invocation

**Step 4: Run the Skill**

```bash
Skill(skill: "code-to-docs", args: "<codebase-path> --mode quick")
```

Record:

- [ ] Invocation timestamp: ____________________________
- [ ] Target codebase: ____________________________
- [ ] Output vault path (from invocation or default): ____________________________
- [ ] Skill completes without error
- [ ] No warnings about missing configuration

**Expected: Quick mode enabled, parallel analysis if 3+ modules.**

---

## Phase 1 Completion: Expected Behavior Checklist

### Survey & Module Identification

- [ ] Survey completes without reading full file contents of any file >500 LOC
- [ ] All 3–5 modules are correctly identified by path
- [ ] Module names are reasonable and match directory/feature names
- [ ] Entry point files are correctly pinpointed
- [ ] No false modules (e.g., build output, `node_modules`, `.git` not counted)

### Parallel Dispatch (if 3+ modules)

- [ ] Skill creates exactly N independent analysis agents (N = number of modules)
- [ ] Each agent receives its module's root paths, entry points, suspected dependencies, and report write path
- [ ] Agents run in parallel (not sequentially)
- [ ] Completion time is roughly time-of-slowest-agent, not sum of all agents

### Agent Execution

For each module agent, verify:

- [ ] **Module 1:** Agent writes `_state/modules/{slug}.md` and returns a receipt
  - [ ] Report file exists at the path named in the receipt
  - [ ] Architecture section present (1–2 paragraphs)
  - [ ] Key Files section lists the 3–7 most important module files
  - [ ] Dependencies section identifies imports outside module
  - [ ] Internal Patterns section lists design patterns observed
  - [ ] Complexity assessment provided
  - [ ] Public API section lists exports/entry points
  - [ ] Report frontmatter has `module`, `slug`, `roots`, `language`, `complexity`, `loc`, `analyzed-at`, `source-commit`

- [ ] **Module 2:** (repeat above)
- [ ] **Module 3:** (repeat above)
- [ ] **(Module 4, 5: as applicable)**

### Reference-Passing Discipline

This is the cost invariant — check the transcript, not just the output files.

- [ ] Each Pass 1 agent **returns a receipt**, not a report: the return value is a small JSON object (report path, root, entry points, language, complexity, loc, files, deps, `escalate`), not seven sections of prose
- [ ] Each Pass 2 prompt contains a **path** to `_state/modules/{slug}.md` — no prompt contains a pasted extraction report
- [ ] Pass 2 model tier matches its module's receipt `escalate` flag (true → Opus, false → Sonnet)
- [ ] The orchestrator does **not** read back a `_state/modules/*.md` file it just had an agent write
- [ ] Pass 2 appends `### Limitations & Improvements` to the existing report file — sections 1–6 are still present and unmodified afterward
- [ ] No Phase 2 agent prompt contains a pasted 7-section report or the full synthesis text

### Synthesis

- [ ] Dependency graph correctly reflects inter-module calls, built from receipt `deps` fields
- [ ] No cycles detected (or cycles are documented with warning)
- [ ] Synthesis produces a single coherent architecture narrative
- [ ] `_state/synthesis.md` is written with all six `##` sections: Architecture Narrative, Architecture Type, System-Wide Patterns, Module Purposes, Cross-Cutting Themes, Issue Themes
- [ ] `## Module Purposes` has exactly one line per identified module
- [ ] `_state/analysis.json` is written to vault root

### State File Validation

- [ ] `_state/analysis.json` exists
- [ ] File is valid JSON
- [ ] Contains fields: `schema_version`, `project`, `modules`, `module_index`, `dependency_graph`, `files_analyzed`, `git_commit`, `timestamp`, `mode`, `issues`, `sessions`
- [ ] `schema_version` equals `2`
- [ ] `modules` array lists all identified modules by name
- [ ] `module_index` has one entry per name in `modules`, and no extra keys
- [ ] Each `module_index` entry has `slug`, `roots` (non-empty array), `report`, and its `report` path exists on disk
- [ ] Every `files_analyzed` **value** is a slug appearing in `module_index` — not a hash, not the string `"analyzed"`
- [ ] Every `files_analyzed` **key** starts with one of its module's recorded `roots`
- [ ] `dependency_graph` has entries for each module
- [ ] `mode` field equals `"quick"`
- [ ] `git_commit` is set (if codebase is a git repo) or null (otherwise)
- [ ] `timestamp` is ISO 8601 format
- [ ] `issues` and `sessions` are present (may be empty arrays, but not omitted)

---

## Phase 4: Quality Analysis

### Beginner Section Quality

For **each module's Beginner section**, verify:

- [ ] Explains language constructs relevant to the module (e.g., async/await, decorators, closures, error handling)
- [ ] Provides simple examples (not pseudocode) from the actual codebase
- [ ] Defines unfamiliar terminology inline (e.g., "middleware," "dependency injection")
- [ ] Does not assume advanced knowledge
- [ ] Beginner section is **different** from Intermediate section (distinct focus)

### Intermediate Section Quality

For **each module's Intermediate section**, verify:

- [ ] Discusses design patterns used in the module (e.g., Repository, Factory, Observer)
- [ ] Explains how this module integrates with other modules
- [ ] Covers configuration and customization points
- [ ] Discusses error handling and edge cases at a design level
- [ ] Intermediate section is **different** from Advanced section (design, not failure modes)

### Advanced Section Quality

For **each module's Advanced section**, verify:

- [ ] Covers concurrency, parallelization, or async complexity
- [ ] Discusses performance implications and bottlenecks
- [ ] Explains failure modes and recovery strategies
- [ ] Addresses resource management (memory, database connections, file handles)
- [ ] Documents known limitations or TODOs in the codebase
- [ ] Advanced section is **not identical** to Intermediate section

### No Fabrication

For **each module**, check:

- [ ] If a design decision is not documented in comments or README, the doc says "Rationale not documented" (not invented)
- [ ] No speculative statements like "likely intended for..." or "probably handles..."
- [ ] Every assertion about behavior is traceable to code or explicit documentation
- [ ] Example code snippets are exact copies from the codebase (not paraphrased)

---

## Phase 5: Red Flag Violations

### Critical Violations (Skill Failure)

If **any** of the following occur, the skill has a critical bug:

- [ ] **Agent reads >500 lines without grep-filtering first**
  - How to detect: Agent logs show `Read(file_path: "...")` for a file known to exceed 500 LOC without prior Grep call
  - Impact: Token waste, incomplete analysis
  - Status: FAIL

- [ ] **3+ modules analyzed sequentially instead of parallel**
  - How to detect: Invocation outputs "Analyzing Module 1... done. Analyzing Module 2..." linearly, not in parallel
  - Impact: Skill fails to meet performance SLA
  - Status: FAIL

- [ ] **Agent reads `node_modules/`, `vendor/`, `.git/`, or build output**
  - How to detect: Files like `node_modules/package/index.js` or `.git/HEAD` are mentioned in agent output
  - Impact: Incorrect analysis, token waste, potential confusion
  - Status: FAIL

- [ ] **Missing frontmatter in any generated file**
  - How to detect: Opening a `.md` file in Obsidian or text editor shows no `---` block at top
  - Impact: Dataview queries fail, metadata missing
  - Status: FAIL

- [ ] **Broken wikilinks (targets don't exist)**
  - How to detect: Wikilink in `Modules/A.md` points to `[[Nonexistent Module]]` but no such file exists
  - Impact: Vault is unusable in Obsidian
  - Status: FAIL

- [ ] **A full analysis report or the full synthesis pasted into an agent prompt**
  - How to detect: A Pass 2 or Phase 2 agent prompt in the transcript contains multiple `###` report sections, or the architecture narrative text, instead of a `_state/` path
  - Impact: The core cost regression this design exists to prevent — the payload is charged as Opus output tokens and then again in the agent's context
  - Status: FAIL

- [ ] **A Pass 1 agent returns its report instead of a receipt**
  - How to detect: The agent's return value in the transcript is prose with `###` headings rather than a small JSON object
  - Impact: The report enters the orchestrator's context at Opus for no reason
  - Status: FAIL

- [ ] **`files_analyzed` values are not module slugs**
  - How to detect: `jq -r '.files_analyzed | to_entries[0].value' _state/analysis.json` returns a hex hash or the string `"analyzed"`
  - Impact: Update cannot map a changed file to its module and falls back to re-surveying
  - Status: FAIL

- [ ] **`module_index` missing, or an entry's `report` path does not exist**
  - How to detect: `jq -r '.module_index[].report' _state/analysis.json | xargs -I{} test -f {}` fails for any entry
  - Impact: The incremental contract is broken; the next update cannot carry modules forward
  - Status: FAIL

### Pattern Violations (Design Issues)

If **any** of the following occur, the skill output has quality issues:

- [ ] **Patterns/, Onboarding/, Cross-Cutting/ directories exist in quick mode**
  - Expected: Quick mode should **not** create these directories
  - Status: WARN / FAIL (depending on severity)

- [ ] **Module file sections missing or incomplete**
  - Check: Every module file has all seven sections (Overview, Architecture, Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, API Reference, Related)
  - Status: FAIL if any section missing

- [ ] **Beginner section is identical to Intermediate**
  - How to detect: Copy text from Beginner section, find it verbatim in Intermediate section
  - Status: FAIL (indicates insufficient analysis)

- [ ] **Advanced section is identical to Intermediate**
  - How to detect: Same check as above
  - Status: FAIL

- [ ] **Canvas nodes reference non-existent files**
  - How to detect: `jq '.nodes[] | .file' Architecture/System\ Map.canvas` returns a path like `Modules/Fake.md` but file doesn't exist
  - Status: FAIL

- [ ] **Mermaid diagram syntax errors**
  - How to detect: Pasting diagram into mermaid.live shows error
  - Status: FAIL

- [ ] **Fabricated design rationale**
  - How to detect: Looking at source code, a statement like "This uses the Facade pattern" is unsupported
  - Status: FAIL
